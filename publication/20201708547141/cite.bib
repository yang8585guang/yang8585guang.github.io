 abstract = {Metabolic analysis needs designed materials to detect target biomarkers of low concentration in biosystems. A further issue is to achieve point-of-care analysis, aimed at hospital and day-to-day use. A multifunctional Pt nanoreactor was constructed through layer-by-layer assembly, achieving both visual detection and LDI MS analysis. The Pt nanoreactor visually quantitates metabolic biomarkers (e.g., glucose), with GOx- and HRP-like catalytic activity. In addition, the Pt nanoreactor enables pancreatic cancer diagnosis with optimal sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 92%.<br/> &copy; 2019 Elsevier Inc.},
