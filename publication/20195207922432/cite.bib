 abstract = {Metabolic fingerprints of biofluids encode diverse diseases and particularly urine detection offers complete non-invasiveness for diagnostics of the future. Present urine detection affords unsatisfactory performance and requires advanced materials to extract molecular information, due to the limited biomarkers and high sample complexity. Herein, we report plasmonic polymer@Ag for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI-MS) and sparse-learning-based metabolic diagnosis of kidney diseases. Using only 1 &mu;L of urine without enrichment or purification, polymer@Ag afforded urine metabolic fingerprints (UMFs) by LDI-MS in seconds. Analysis by sparse learning discriminated lupus nephritis from various other non-lupus nephropathies and controls. We combined UMFs with urine protein levels (UPLs) and constructed a new diagnostic model to characterize subtypes of kidney diseases. Our work guides urine-based diagnosis and leads to new personalized analytical tools for other diseases.<br/> &copy; 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim},
