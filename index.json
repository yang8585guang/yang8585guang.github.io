Herein, we studied cation adduction and fragmentation of small metabolites by a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, via nanoparticle-assisted laser desorption/ionization (LDI)-MS and MS/MS. We calculated the energies of adduction conformers and atomic bond orders to establish the rules of cation‚Äìmetabolite affinity and multiple cation adductions in charge transfer. Further, we demonstrated the reaction paths of adducted ions and mapped the potential energy surfaces to characterize the loss of given groups during fragmentation. Finally, we successfully controlled metabolite fragmentation by selected and multiple adductions to enhance the atomic/fragment coverage as defined for metabolite identification toward profiling. Considering the success of MS in the analysis of large biomolecules, our work may have an impact and guide to advanced analysis of small metabolites. ¬© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","tags":["Biomolecules","Charge transfer","Desorption","Mass spectrometry","Nanoparticles","Positiveions","Potential energy","Quantum chemistry"],"title":"Nanoparticle-Assisted Cation Adduction and Fragmentation of Small Metabolites","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guojun Lan","Jing Yang","Run-Ping Ye","Yash Boyjoo","Ji Liang","Xiaoyan Liu","Ying Li","Jian Liu","Kun Qian"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641456106,"objectID":"620aaa0522d06f15d9c370d5c93fea37","permalink":"https://yang8585guang.github.io/publication/20211410162936/","publishdate":"2022-01-06T08:01:45.947024Z","relpermalink":"/publication/20211410162936/","section":"publication","summary":"It is desirable for a sustainable society that the production and utilization of renewable materials are net-zero in terms of carbon emissions. Carbon materials with emerging applications in CO2 utilization, renewable energy storage and conversion, and biomedicine have attracted much attention both academically and industrially. However, the preparation process of some new carbon materials suffers from energy consumption and environmental pollution issues. Therefore, the development of low-cost, scalable, industrially and economically attractive, sustainable carbon material preparation methods are required. In this regard, the use of biomass and its derivatives as a precursor of carbon materials is a major feature of sustainability. Recent advances in the synthetic strategy of sustainable carbon materials and their emerging applications are summarized in this short review. Emphasis is made on the discussion of the original intentions and various sustainable strategies for producing sustainable carbon materials. This review provides basic insights and significant guidelines for the further design of sustainable carbon materials and their emerging applications in catalysis and the biomedical field. ¬© 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","tags":["Carbon","Costs","Energy storage","Energy utilization","Environmental impact"],"title":"Sustainable Carbon Materials toward Emerging Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mengji Zhang","Lin Huang","Jing Yang","Wei Xu","Haiyang Su","Jing Cao","Qian Wang","Jun Pu","Kun Qian"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1641456105,"objectID":"1cea47848785b0fdbb3e8fc5e5ee22f6","permalink":"https://yang8585guang.github.io/publication/20213210728623/","publishdate":"2022-01-06T08:01:45.680151Z","relpermalink":"/publication/20213210728623/","section":"publication","summary":"Although mass spectrometry (MS) of metabolites has the potential to provide real-time monitoring of patient status for diagnostic purposes, the diagnostic application of MS is limited due to sample treatment and data quality/reproducibility.

Nanoparticle-assisted laser desorption/ionization-MS is used to achieve direct metabolic analysis of trace unprocessed serum in seconds. Furthermore, a deep stabilizer is constructed to map native MS results to high-quality results obtained by established methods. Finally, using the newly developed protocol and diagnosis variation characteristic surface to characterize sensitivity/specificity and variation, CHD is diagnosed with advanced accuracy in a high-throughput/speed manner.

Developing a dual-functional material is challenging and in demand, engaging advanced applications for both defined bioanalysis and targeted biotoxicity. Herein, magnetic silver nanoshells are designed as a multifunctional platform for the detection and inhibition of bacteria. The optimized magnetic silver nanoshells enable direct laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry based metabolic analysis of bacteria (‚âà10 ¬µL‚àí1), in complex biofluids. The serum infection process (0‚Äì10 h) is monitored by statistics toward clinical classification. Moreover, magnetic silver nanoshells facilitate surface adhesion on bacteria due to nanoscale surface roughness and thus display long-term antibacterial effects. Bacteria metabolism is studied with metabolic biomarkers (e.g., malate and lysine) identified during inhibition, showing cell membrane destruction and dysfunctional protein synthesis mechanisms. This work not only guides the design of material-based approaches for bioanalysis and biotoxicity, but contributes to bacteria-related diagnosis by using specific metabolic biomarkers for sensitive detection and new insights by monitoring metabolomic change of bacteria for antibacterial applications. ¬© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \u0026 Co.
